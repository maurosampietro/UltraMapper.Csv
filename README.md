# UltraMapper.Csv

Whenever you need to transform text in a strong-typed object 2 steps are involved:
- text analysis (the actual parsing)
- mapping step 
  
With the help of UltraMapper, it is possible to decouple those 2 steps,
delegating the mapping stage completely to UltraMapper and obtaining excellent performance.

Check out the other parsers using UltraMapper for the mapping stage:
