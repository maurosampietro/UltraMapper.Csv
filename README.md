# About UltraMapper-based parsers

UltraMapper makes it easy to write a performant parser of any kind, from scratch and in little time.

Every parser performs two basic tasks: the actual text analysis and a mapping step.

UltraMapper and UltraMapper.Parsing allows you to completely separate the two steps leading to clear and straightforward code.
You are only in charge of implementing the text-analysis part

**Even though much more than just basic funcionality has already been implemented; this repository is still considered a beta.**    
**While in beta, Nuget packages and builds won't be available.**
