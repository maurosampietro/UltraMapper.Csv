# UltraMapper.Csv

UltraMapper.Csv is a full-fledged parser for CSV, FIXEDWIDTH and other data file-formats.
The goal of this project is to show how UltraMapper can make it easy to write a performant, full-fledged parser of any kind.




Every parser performs two basic tasks: the actual text analysis and a mapping step.
UltraMapper and UltraMapper.Parsing allows you to completely separate the two steps, leading to clear and straightforward code.

Even though much more than just basic funcionality has already been implemented; this repository is still considered a beta:
UltraMapper.Csv and UltraMapper.Json and UltraMapper.CommandLine are the 3 main projects driving the need of new features of, and an easier way to integrate with UltraMapper
